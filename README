  = Read me =

    This is a Coda/SubEthaEdit syntax coloring mode for the CoffeeScript language.
    It's plenty rough around the edges, but it's usable.
    
    It's still under development (in my spare time).
    
    I mostly based it on the built-in JavaScript Mode.
    Special thanks to Bredeshwar's Sass.Mode.
    I used it for reference while developing this mode.




  = Known issues =
  
  - Comment bug:
    When you press Command + / on a line consisting of "###",
    Coda will throw a grumpy error, and suggest you shut it down.
    No clue what's causing this.
    May have to track down the guys at Coding Monkeys.





  = To-do =
  
  - Choose colors
    I have been using same colors as Javascript mode.
    Need to choose colors in an intentional, designerly fashion.
  

  
  - Colorize functions:
    ->
    =>
    (args) ->
    (args) =>
    
  - Colorize mathematical operators?
    Maybe we should colorize characters like +, -, *, /, and ()ÐÐparens only if not preceding a function
    
  - Colorize boolean operators?
    Could distinguish if, else, unless, and, or, &&, ||, ==, <, > from other types of operators
    
  - Colorize =, :, or=
    These symbols set one thing equal to another.
    Maybe they should be set apart.
    or= might fit better with boolean operators, 
    or maybe we color 'or'like a boolean operator and '=' like an equality operator
  
  
  
  - Can we have single line auto-comment?
    Now, Command + '/' keyboard shortcut wraps a single line in "### ###".
    I would prefer it prepended single line comments with "#",
    and multi-line comments with "### ###"
