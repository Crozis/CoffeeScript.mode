  = Read me =

    This is a Coda/SubEthaEdit syntax coloring mode for the CoffeeScript language.
    It's plenty rough around the edges, but it's usable.
    It's still under development (in my spare time).
    
    I mostly based it on the built-in JavaScript Mode.
    Special thanks to Brajeshwar's Sass.Mode;
    I used it for reference while developing this mode.

    Checkout template.coffee file (in Coda with the mode installed) to see what works and what doesn't.


  = Installation =

  - Download and unpack either the ZIP or TAR version of the CoffeeScript mode.

  - Coda:
	Manually copy the CoffeeScript.mode directory into ~/Library/Application\ Support/Coda/Modes/.

  - SubEthaEdit:
	Open the CoffeeScript.mode file from within SubEthaEdit using the File > Open command 
	or by dragging the CoffeeScript.mode file onto the SubEthaEdit application icon in the dock.



  = Known issues =
  
  - Comment bug:
    When you press Command + / on a line consisting of "###",
    Coda will throw a grumpy error, and suggest you shut it down.
    No clue what's causing this.
    May have to track down the guys at Coding Monkeys.



  = To-do =
  
  - Choose colors
    I have been using same colors as Javascript mode.
    Need to choose colors in an intentional, designerly fashion.
  

  
  - Colorize function arguments:
    Should we colorize args inside the function 
    the same as the function? Differently? treat as "default?"
	
  - Colorize instance variables
	Make @vars stand out.
    
  - Colorize mathematical operators?
    Maybe we should colorize characters like +, -, *, /, and ()--parens only if not preceding a function
    
  - Colorize boolean operators?
    Could distinguish if, else, unless, and, or, not, &&, ||, ==, <, >, ?, ?= from other types of operators
    
  - Colorize =, :, or=
    These have the same appearance as the vars they come after.
	This is fine for now, but I may want to change the color slightly.
  
  
  
  - Can we have single line auto-comment?
    Now, Command + '/' keyboard shortcut wraps a single line in "### ###".
    I would prefer it prepended single line comments with "#",
    and multi-line comments with "### ###"
